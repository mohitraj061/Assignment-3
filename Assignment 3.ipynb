    "Ques 1.) Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Reusability : Functions allow you to encapsulate a specific set of instructions and logic into\n",
    "    a single block of code that can be reused throughout the program. By defining a function, you\n",
    "    can call it multiple times from different parts of your program without having to repeat the \n",
    "    same code, making your program more efficient, modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Modularity : Functions promote modular programming by breaking down complex tasks into smaller,\n",
    "    more manageable pieces. Each function can be responsible for a specific task or a small part of \n",
    "    the overall program. This modular approach enhances code organization, readability, and maintainability.\n",
    "    It also enables different team members to work on different functions simultaneously, fostering \n",
    "    collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Abstraction : Functions provide a level of abstraction, allowing you to focus on the high-level\n",
    "    functionality of your program without worrying about the implementation details of individual \n",
    "    functions. By using well-designed function interfaces, you can hide the underlying implementation\n",
    "    complexity and provide a simplified interface for other parts of the program to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Code organization and readability : Functions help in structuring your code by logically dividing it\n",
    "    into smaller, self-contained units. This improves code organization and makes it easier to navigate \n",
    "    and understand. With functions, you can give meaningful names to different parts of your program,\n",
    "    making it more readable and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Code reuse and maintenance : Functions promote code reuse, which can save you time and effort. \n",
    "    Instead of duplicating code throughout your program, you can define functions once and reuse\n",
    "    them whenever needed. This reduces code redundancy and makes maintenance and updates more manageable.\n",
    "    If a bug is found or an improvement is needed, you only have to modify the function in one place\n",
    "    and the changes will propagate throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.) Testing and debugging : Functions simplify the testing and debugging process. Since functions \n",
    "    encapsulate specific functionality, they can be tested in isolation, making it easier to identify\n",
    "    and fix issues. This modular approach allows for more focused and targeted testing, as well as \n",
    "    easier unit testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using functions in your programs promotes code reuse, modularity, organization, and abstraction,\n",
    "leading to more efficient and maintainable code."

    "    \n",
    "The code inside a function runs when the function is called.\n",

    "When you define a function, you are essentially creating a reusable block of code with a specific name\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task or a set of tasks. It is a reusable \n",
    "piece of code that can be called or invoked from different parts of a program. A function typically takes some \n",
    "input, called arguments or parameters, performs certain operations, and optionally returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a function call is the actual invocation or execution of a function. When you make a function\n",
    "call, you are instructing the program to execute the code inside the function. A function call consists of the \n",
    "function name followed by parentheses, and may include arguments inside the parentheses if the function expects any.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference :\n",

    "# Function definition\n",

    "Ques 5.) How many global scopes are there in a Python program ? How many local scopes ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The global scope refers to the outermost level of the program, where variables, functions, and classes are defined\n",
    "outside of any function or class definition. The global scope is accessible from anywhere in the program, and variables\n",
    "defined in this scope are considered global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scopes, on the other hand, are created whenever a function or a class method is invoked. Each function call\n",
    "creates its own local scope, which is separate from the global scope. Local scopes are used to store variables that\n",
    "are specific to the function or method being executed. These variables are called local variables and are only \n",
    "accessible within their respective scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that local scopes are hierarchical. Each nested function call creates a new local scope, which\n",
    "is stacked on top of the previous scopes. When a variable is referenced within a scope, Python first looks for that \n",
    "variable in the local scope. If it's not found, Python continues to search in the higher scopes until it reaches the \n",

    "Ques 6.) What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function call returns in Python, the local scope associated with that function is destroyed, and any variables\n",
    "defined within that scope are deallocated from memory. This process is known as variable scope and lifetime management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate this behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    x = 10  # Local variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Other code...\n",

    "\n",
    "print(x)  # NameError: name 'x' is not defined\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the function my_function() defines a local variable x with a value of 10. When the function is \n",
    "called and executed, the variable x exists within the local scope of that function. The function then returns the value\n",
    "of x, which is assigned to the variable result in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, once the function call returns, the local scope of my_function() is destroyed, and the variable x is no longer\n",
    "accessible. If you try to access x outside the function, as demonstrated in the last line of the example, you will \n",
    "encounter a NameError because x is not defined in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior ensures that local variables are temporary and only exist within the scope of the function where they are\n",
    "defined. It helps maintain encapsulation and prevents conflicts between variables in different scopes."

    "Ques 7.) What is the concept of a return value ? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a return value is associated with functions in programming. A return value is the value that a function \n",
    "sends back or \"returns\" to the caller after executing its code. It allows a function to provide a result or output that\n",
    "can be utilized by the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function encounters a return statement, it evaluates the expression following the return keyword and then exits\n",

    "strings, booleans, lists, or even more complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example :\n",

    "\n",
    "result = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the add_numbers() function takes two arguments a and b and returns their sum using the return\n",
    "statement. The function call add_numbers(3, 5) returns the value 8, which is assigned to the variable result. The print()\n",
    "statement then outputs the value of result, which is 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding second question, yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression. In Python, we can directly\n",
    "use a function call within an expression or assign its return value to a variable. This allows you to use the return\n",

    "print(my_variable)     # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have a global variable my_variable initialized with the value 10. Inside the my_function(), \n",
    "we declare my_variable as global using the global keyword. This allows us to modify the global variable's value within \n",
